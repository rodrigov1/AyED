In this repository, both my group partner and I, have been creating the code necessary to perform the Final Exam of the AyED subject of FCEFYN (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales - UNC). The codes have been performed on both Windows and Linux through collaboration with git/github workflow. Once downloaded the file, to compile and run the project use the **make run** command and on the other hand, **make clean** to delete it.
